**Warning:** this blog post contains spoilers for the Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer

### The story so far
If you haven't seen the true crime documentary series Making a Murderer yet, go watch it! The Netflix series gives a fascinating insight in the  American justice system and how it seems to fail to adhere to the principle of guilty beyond reasonable doubt. It has caused quite a buzz and on reddit amateur sleuths are trying to find evidence to break the case open and free Steven Avery.

In the documentary we see the confession of Steven's nephew, Brendan Dassey. Brendan is a boy with learning disabilities and is interrogated without any help present by two trained policemen for 6 hours. In this interrogation Brendan confesses helping Steven Avery rape and murder Theresa Halbach. On this confession alone he is convicted for life. In Making a Murderer the confession seems extremely fishy, with the detectives Fassbender and Wiegert seemingly feeding Brendan's confession to him. In one part the detectives just tell Brendan he shot the victim in the head because he can't think of it:

> FASSBENDER: Did he say why he wanted you to do that?
> BRENDAN: No. (shakes head “no”)
> WIEGERT: Which knife did you use?
> BRENDAN: The same one he stabbed her with.
> FASASBENDER: And how many times did he stab her again?
> BRENDAN: Once.
> FASSBENDER: Are you sure about that? (Brendan nods “yes”)
> WIEGERT: So Steve stabs her first and then you cut her neck? (Brendan nods “yes”) What else happens to her in her head?
> FASSBENDER: It’s extremely, extremely important you tell us this, for us to believe you.
> WIEGERT: Come on Brendan, what else?
> (pause)
> FASSBENDER: We know, we just need you to tell us.
> BRENDAN: That’s all I can remember.
> WIEGERT: All right, I’m just gonna come out and ask you. Who shot her in the head?
> BRENDAN: He did.
> FASSBENDER: Then why didn’t you tell us that?
> BRENDAN: Cuz I couldn’t think of it.




While the only evidence against him is his own confession (which seems extremely inconsistent and which he later retracts), the jury still finds him guilty of all charges (rape, murder, etc.) This confession was obtained on 1 March 2006 in an interview which lasted over 6 hours and at which time Brendan was a minor. He had noone to help him, no lawyer and faced two trained policemen.
