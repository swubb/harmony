Hello! I am an Assistant Professor at the Tilburg Center for Cognition and Communication. My fields of interest are Natural Language Generation and Natural Language Processing. Currently Iâ€™m mainly working on sequence to sequence generation, with applications in the domains of sentence simplification, summarization and paraphrasing.
